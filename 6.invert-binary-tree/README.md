# Invert binary Tree

| No  | Approach  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Summary                                  |

| 1   | Recursion | O(n)            | O(n)             | use recursion to invert the binary tree. |

## comparison

- too simple so no need to compare but memory efficiency is better in `c++` implementation.

## Performance Comparison

| Language   | Runtime | Memory |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| C++        | 0ms     | 12.5MB |
| JavaScript | 0ms     | 53.2MB |

## Learn

- Linked lists or tree structures seem to be data structures where recursion can be effectively utilized. When I was writing i18n scripts or code generators, I used recursion extensively. I think structuring objects this way would make those tasks more manageable.
