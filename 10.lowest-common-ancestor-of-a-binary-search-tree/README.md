# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

| No  | Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Summary           |
| --- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | BST      | O(log n) ~ O(n) | O(n)             | diff by structure |

## comparison

- c++ implementation uses less `memory` and `runtime`.
- New to BST
- BST is ordered side by value
- Hierarchy doesn't matter for sub's sub node. just compare current node.

## Performance Comparison

| Language   | Runtime | Memory |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| C++        | 14ms    | 23.5MB |
| JavaScript | 56ms    | 65.3MB |
